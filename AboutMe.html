	<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/aboutme.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Hi, I'm Zhuoru Zhang, a student at Northwestern University Master of Science in Robotics program. I graduated from East China Normal University with a B.S. in Telecommunication Engineering. My interests in robotics field stems from the experience of participating in the build of a Quadcopter, and from where I gained valuable hands-on experience of building and designing a real robot system. Using techniques to solve some real-world problems and make the robots become more intelligent to better help people is what I am trying to do. In the future, I hope to explore more into the field of perception of robot, Simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM), localization, Machine Learning. If you have more questions, please contact me at <b>shirleyzzr1@gmail.com</b>      <a href="/images/Zhuoru_Zhang_resume.pdf">Download resume here</a></p>
